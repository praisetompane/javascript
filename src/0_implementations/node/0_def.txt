def node:
    - event driven IO
        - non-blocking IO framework
    - a tool for networking
        written on top of Google V8(Dahl, 2011)

    - single-threaded process
        - share-nothing model
            must use a protocol to talk to other process
                - protocol = {tcp, http, grpc ...}

    - applications:
        - networking services
        - ...
properties (Dahl, 2011):
    the program never:
        - stops
        - sleep
        - execute IO and wait
            example: open file, fetch URL

        NB: the ability to sleep is sealed off completely in node.
        You can only idle:
            in idle:
                - CPU usage goes to zero
                - OS unschedules it

        hence non-blocking
    examples:
        src/node/0_non_block_1.js
        src/node/0_non_block.js

    process exit:
        - node waits until all calla=backs are resolved 
            before gracefull automatically existing
